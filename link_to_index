you have to go to “Settings” of the repository then go down to “Github Pages” option. Select the “main/master” (depending on your repository) and “root”.
You will see the link to your page in the Github pages bar. Wait for it till it changes to green color or try that link after few minutes. 
Using that link you can see your html file.
